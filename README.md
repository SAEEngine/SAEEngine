# SAEEngine
A C++ game engine designed to be integrated into a project as a tool - not the focal point.

This repo is collection of the component libraries that make up the engine. If you only wish to use a particular portion of the engine check out the [other repositories](https://github.com/SAEEngine) under this organization.
